many().multicast(): a sink that will transmit only newly pushed data to its subscribers, honoring their backpressure
                    (newly pushed as in "after the subscriberâ€™s subscription").

many().unicast(): same as above, with the twist that data pushed before the first subscriber registers is buffered.

many().replay(): a sink that will replay a specified history size of pushed data to new subscribers then continue
                 pushing new data live.

one(): a sink that will play a single element to its subscribers

empty(): a sink that will play a terminal signal only to its subscribers (error or complete),
         but can still be viewed as a Mono<T> (notice the generic type <T>).
